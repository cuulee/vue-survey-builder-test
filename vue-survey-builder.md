# vue-survey-builder
This is a survey builder component for vue.js applications.

### How to install
You can install the component using `npm i -S vue-survey-builder`

### Demo
You can see the demo [here](http://vue-survey-builder.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/#/)

### Demo Source Code
Please look at the sample code [here](https://github.com/rajeshwarpatlolla/vue-survey-builder-test)

### Steps to use
*Step 1:*
Once you it install, you can import the `SurveyBuilder` by

`import SurveyBuilder from 'SurveyBuilder';`

*Step 2:*
Then you can use it in your vue component like this

`<SurveyBuilder :options="sampleQuestion" />`

Here `sampleQuestion` can be the json, which is [here](https://github.com/FissionHQ/vue-survey-builder/blob/master/src/survey-builder.json)

This is used to create a new question.

*Step 3:*
We are using [this JSON](https://github.com/FissionHQ/vue-survey-builder/blob/master/src/survey-builder.json) to build any type of question. Depending on the type of question, only few keys are used in the whole JSON.

It emits an event called `add-update-question` with a question object and the type
`this.$root.$emit('add-update-question', question);`

In your component, keep track of this event to capture it
````
mounted() {
    this.$root.$on('add-update-question', question => {
      window.console.log(question);
    });
  },
````
When you get the object, you can cross check for the `id`, in the list of questions you have. If the `id` exists, then it means there is an update to the question, if the `id` doesn't exist, then you can directly add the question to the list of questions.
You can refer the sample code in the [demo repository](https://github.com/rajeshwarpatlolla/vue-survey-builder-test/blob/master/src/components/TestSurveyBuilder.vue#L30)

*Step 4:*
You can add your own logic in your component to show the list of question in read only and edit mode. There is a component to show the list of questions, which will be available in the [src folder](https://github.com/FissionHQ/vue-survey-builder/blob/master/src/QuestionsView.vue) itself. Please use it in case, if you want to show the questions added.

In the next version, this component will be available as part of the vue-survey-builder itself. Refer demo code [here](https://github.com/rajeshwarpatlolla/vue-survey-builder-test/blob/master/src/components/TestSurveyBuilder.vue#L5)

You can use it like

`<QuestionsView :questions="questionsList" :readOnly="true" />`

- `questions` is a property which takes an array of questions.

- `readOnly` is used to make the whole component editable or non editable, based on the value we pass. It takes true or false.
